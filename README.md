# Hi, I'm Alif! ðŸ‘‹

I am a mobile application developer with **over 4 years of experience** creating applications for Android, iOS and Web using Flutter. I have completed **more than 20 projects** for clients who are highly satisfied with the results.

I always try to use best practices and create user-friendly interfaces. I am also a huge fan of open-source technologies and love contributing to the community.
